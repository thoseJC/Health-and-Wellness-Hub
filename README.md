## Project description:
The project for High Country Health and Wellness Hub, aims to simplify their manual system. This means handing member information, class bookings, therapist schedules, payments, and reports. Members pay monthly or yearly to join classes and see therapists. Booking is open from 9am to 7pm every day, except Christmas and Boxing Day. Members, therapists, and managers can check profiles, bookings, and news.
